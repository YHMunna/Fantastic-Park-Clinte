      <p>
        Fantastic Park is the world's top theme parks, reaching an average of
        more than a million visitors a month across all our channels. We've
        beennamed the top theme park site on the Internet . As editor of
        Fantastic Park, I have been quoted frequently in international news
        media with appearances on CNN, the BBC, CBS, and NPR.I also write a
        weekly column on theme parks for the Orange County Register in
        California. Theme Park Insider's writers have been credentialed for news
        coverage by many major theme park resorts, including Disneyland,
        Disneyland Paris, Universal Orlando, Universal Studios Hollywood,
        Universal Studios Singapore, Yas Island, Dubai Parks, SeaWorld Orlando,
        Busch Gardens Tampa, and Knott's Berry Farm. Why theme parks? My parents
        started bringing me to Disneyland before I could walk, and I quickly
        fell in love. In college, I got a job working at Walt Disney World's
        Magic Kingdom, where I drove the Tom Sawyer Island rafts and loaded
        people on Pirates of the Caribbean. After school, I went into journalism
        and worked at several newspapers (Omaha World-Herald, Rocky Mountain
        News, Los Angeles Times), developing Theme Park Insider in my spare time
        before making it my full-time job. If you would like to get in touch
        with me directly, my email address is fantasticpark@gmail.com. Thank you
        for visiting!
